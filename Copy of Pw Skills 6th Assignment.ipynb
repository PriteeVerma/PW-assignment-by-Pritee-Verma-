It means we think there is an effect or difference when actually there isn’t one. The probability of making a Type I error is called alpha (α), often set at 0.05.\n","\n","- A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis, meaning we miss a real effect or difference. The probability of making a Type II error is beta (β), and the power of a test is (1 - β).\n","\n","**These errors affect decision-making because:**\n","\n","- A Type I error can lead to believing something is true when it’s not (false positive).\n","\n","- A Type II error can lead to ignoring a real effect (false negative).\n","So, choosing the right significance level helps balance both errors."],"metadata":{"id":"PMAOU21Si-E_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 2:What is the P-value in hypothesis testing, and how should it be interpreted\n","in the context of the null hypothesis?**\n","-\n","**Answer:**\n","-\n","The P-value is the probability of getting a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed result, if the null hypothesis is true.\n","\n","- A small P-value (less than 0.05) means there’s strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so we usually reject it.\n","\n","- A large P-value (greater than 0.05) suggests there isn’t enough evidence to reject the null, so we fail to reject it.\n","\n","**In short:**\n","- the P-value helps decide whether the sample data provides enough proof to reject the null hypothesis."],"metadata":{"id":"k_pEy7Enj-8g"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 3:Explain the difference between a Z-test and a T-test, including when to use\n","each.**\n","-\n","**Answer:**\n","-\n","The Z-test and T-test are both used to compare means, but they differ mainly in sample size and data assumptions.\n","\n","- Z-test: Used when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large (n > 30).\n","\n","- T-test: Used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small (n < 30).\n","\n","Both tests assume the data are approximately normally distributed.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","-\n","\n","- Z-test → Testing average height of students when population σ is known.\n","\n","- T-test → Testing mean exam score of a small class when σ is unknown"],"metadata":{"id":"Q08SJy38kLk3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 4:What is a confidence interval, and how does the margin of error influence\n","its width and interpretation?**\n","-\n","**Answer:**\n","-\n"," - A confidence interval (CI) gives a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter (like the mean). For example, a 95% CI means we are 95% confident that the true mean lies within that range.\n","\n","**The margin of error (ME) affects how wide the CI is:**\n","-\n","\n","- A larger ME → wider interval → less precise estimate.\n","\n","- A smaller ME → narrower interval → more precise estimate.\n","\n","ME depends on the sample size, variability, and confidence level.

Samples are independent.\n","\n","- 2. Data are approximately normally distributed.\n","\n","- 3. Variances are equal across groups (homogeneity of variance).\n","\n","ANOVA extends hypothesis testing by analyzing all groups at once instead of running multiple t-tests, which increases the chance of error.\n","\n","If ANOVA shows a significant difference, we use post-hoc tests (like Tukey’s test) to find which groups differ."],"metadata":{"id":"ChAR0JA9kRWx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Question 6: Write a Python program to perform a one-sample Z-test and interpret the\n","result for a given dataset.**\n","-\n","**Answer:**\n","-"],"metadata":{"id":"NfSYOG49kSbk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","from scipy import stats\n","\n","# Sample data\n","data = [55, 60, 58, 62, 57, 59, 61, 63, 56, 60]\n","mean_population = 58\n","std_population = 3\n","\n","# Perform one-sample Z-test\n","sample_mean = np.mean(data)\n","n = len(data)\n","z = (sample_mean - mean_population) / (std_population / np.sqrt(n))\n","\n","# Calculate p-value\n","p_value = 2 * (1 - stats.norm.cdf(abs(z)))\n","\n","print(\"Z-score:\", z)\n","print(\"P-value:\", p_value)\n","\n","if p_value < 0.05:\n","    print(\"Reject Null Hypothesis\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pSIfwgPtoFmU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Interpretation:**\n","-\n","\n","- If the p-value < 0.05, it means the sample mean is significantly different from the population mean.
